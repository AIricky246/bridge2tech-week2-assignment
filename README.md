## üèóÔ∏è Build Your Portfolio (35 minutes)

### **Start with this basic structure in index.html:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Your Name - Web Developer Portfolio</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Your Full Name</h1>
        <!-- Add navigation here -->
    </header>

    <main>
        <!-- Add your content sections here -->
    </main>

    <!-- Add footer here -->
</body>
</html>
```

### **Required Content Sections:**

#### **1. Navigation (Research Required)**
- Create a navigation menu with links to: About, Skills, Goals, Contact
- **Hint:** Look up how to create navigation lists and internal page links
- **Challenge:** Make the links actually work by connecting them to your sections

#### **2. About Me Section**
```html
<section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <!-- Add an image placeholder here - figure out the right element and attributes -->
    
    <p>Write 2-3 sentences introducing yourself.</p>
    
    <!-- Create a list of 3 things about your background -->
    
    <h3>My Story</h3>
    <p>Write about your journey to web development.</p>
</section>
```

#### **3. Skills Section** 
```html
<section id="skills">
    <h2>My Skills & Interests</h2>
    
    <h3>Technical Skills I'm Learning</h3>
    <!-- Create a bulleted list of skills -->
    
    <h3>Other Skills</h3>
    <!-- Create another list of non-programming skills -->
    
    <h3>My Top 5 Hobbies</h3>
    <!-- Research: What HTML element creates numbered lists? -->
</section>
```

#### **4. Goals Section**
```html
<section id="goals">
    <h2>My Goals</h2>
    
    <h3>What I Want to Learn This Year</h3>
    <!-- Add your learning goals as a list -->
    
    <h3>Career Goals</h3>
    <!-- Add your career aspirations -->
    
    <!-- Challenge: Add a subsection about dream projects -->
</section>
```

#### **5. Contact Section (Research Required)**
```html
<section id="contact">
    <h2>Get In Touch</h2>
    
    <!-- Research: What HTML element is used for contact information? -->

4. **Different list types** - What's the difference between bulleted and numbered lists?

5. **Contact information element** - There's a specific HTML element for contact details - what is it?

## üí° Problem-Solving Tips

### **When you get stuck:**
1. **Check the class notes** - We covered these elements in Week 1
2. **Use the resources** - W3Schools has great examples
3. **Look at examples** - Search for "HTML navigation menu example"
4. **Test frequently** - Open your HTML file in a browser to see what works

### **For research:**
- Search for: "HTML [element name] example"
- Look for simple, clear examples
- Don't worry about styling - focus on structure
- Copy syntax patterns, but use your own content

### **Common issues:**
- **Links don't work:** Check your `href` attributes
- **Lists look wrong:** Make sure you're using the right list elements
- **Navigation doesn't link to sections:** Verify your `id` attributes match your links

---

## üéØ What Success Looks Like

**When you're done:**
- You can click navigation links and jump to different sections
- All your lists display correctly (bulleted and numbered)
- Your contact links work (email opens mail program)
- Your HTML validates without errors at https://validator.w3.org/
- Your GitHub repository shows 4 meaningful commits

---

## üèÜ Stretch Goals (If you finish early)

- Add more sections like "Fun Facts" or "Learning Resources"
- Research and add a table showing your weekly schedule
- Figure out how to add more semantic elements like `<article>` or `<aside>`
- Add more external links to your favorite learning resources

## üéì Learning Outcomes

This assignment tests your ability to:
- ‚úÖ Apply HTML knowledge to solve new problems
- ‚úÖ Research and learn new HTML elements independently
- ‚úÖ Create a complete, functional webpage
- ‚úÖ Use professional Git workflow
- ‚úÖ Problem-solve when you encounter challenges

**Remember:** The goal isn't to memorize every HTML element, but to know how to find and use the right elements for your content. Real developers look things up all the time! üåü
